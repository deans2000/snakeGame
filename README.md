# Snake Game

This is a simple implementation of the classic Snake game in Python. The game is played in the console and uses the `numpy` library for the game board representation.

## Features

- Move the snake using `w`, `a`, `s`, `d` keys for up, left, down, and right respectively.
- Eat food to grow the snake.
- Avoid running into the walls or the snake's own body to keep playing.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `numpy` library

## Setup

1. **Clone the repository or download the code:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/deans2000/snakeGame.git
   cd snakeGame

2. **Install the prerequisites:**
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt

## Run the game

To run the game, simply copy and paste the following code into your terminal:
    ```sh
    python main.py


## How to play

- Use the following keys to control the snake:
  - `w`: Move up
  - `a`: Move left
  - `s`: Move down
  - `d`: Move right
- Press `enter` after typing the keys
- The objective is to eat the food (`o`) that appears on the board. Each time the snake eats the food, it grows longer.
- Avoid running into the walls or the snake's own body, as this will end the game.
